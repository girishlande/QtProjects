In this project there are 2 progress bars and 3 independent button. 
You can click on start to start particular progress bar. 
This starts a corresponding thread and updates progress bar. 
Simultaneously you can press on the color buttons and you will see that the 
label is updating whilest the progress bars are updating on User interface. 

This is very common thing to be done in UI project and one should know how to 
do that. 


This project will explain how to create thread by deriving from QThread class. 
How to update multiple UI elements simultaneouly while keeping UI available 
for other tasks. 

This is good demo project explaining Thread uses in simpler manner. 

This is not advised by some people as it inherits from QThread class. But this 
is one of the simplest way of implementing multithreading in your UI project.
